# 💫 About Me

Hi, I’m **Seemab Hassan** 👋  
🎓 Final-year CS Student | Passionate about AI & ML | Exploring Everything Under the AI Umbrella  

I’m on a mission to turn complex AI ideas into real-world impact — whether it's moderating images, decoding language, or deploying models that actually *do stuff*.  

> 🧠 "AI isn't just about machines thinking — it's about making tech more *human-aware*, useful, and ethical."

## 🌟 Quick Intro

- 🔍 Started with Python notebooks, now building full-stack ML pipelines  
- 🤖 Love making AI systems that *see*, *understand*, and *react* to the world  
- 🛠 Currently exploring **Computer Vision**, **NLP**, and **Generative AI**  
- 💡 Always open to learning new tools, frameworks, or just vibing over ideas!

## 🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of

- 🧼 **AI-Powered Image Moderation System**  
  Custom CNN classifier to detect inappropriate content (weapons, gore, hate signs) with real-time backend integration, threshold tuning & ensemble comparison (EfficientNet + Custom CNN).

- 👁️ **YOLOv8 & YOLOv9 for Object Detection**  
  Built detection pipelines for safety-critical environments using annotated datasets and live testing.

- 💌 **Smart Email Generator (NLP + Gemini API)**  
  Automated bulk email customization using NLP models; deployed with a sleek Firebase + React frontend.

- 📈 **Dogecoin Forecasting System**  
  LSTM-GRU + XGBoost hybrid model to predict price trends, with custom evaluation metrics & signal generation logic.

## 🎯 What Drives Me?

The thrill of creating tech that can *learn, adapt, and grow*.  
From building image classifiers that **protect users**, to writing code that can **understand language**, my core focus is to make AI:

- 🔐 **Safe**
- ⚡ **Scalable**
- 💬 **Human-aware**

I’m especially hyped about ethical AI, real-time deployment, and using machine learning for social good.
